This is a dummy repository I made to refresh my extensive bash scripting knowledge.

Remember for all the scripts to work you have to add executeable permissions to it ie 

run:

chmod u+x <Script.sh>

Hopefully I will add powershell too if I have the time.

Feel free to use my codes,generally there are 2 sides to the repository game scripts and useful scripts

I will also try using github co-pilot/AWS code whisperer for serious scripts but I will attach any AI help in the commit message.

There is a .gitignore file but I included it in the .gitignore file itself so it isnt pushed.
