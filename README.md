This is a dummy repository I made to refresh my extensive bash scripting knowledge.

Hopefully I will add powershell too if I have the time.

Feel free to use my codes,generally there are 2 branches to this repo:
    main : Useful bash scripts. *This is where you are currently.
    games : Games that I made in bash and also their individual files.

I will also try using github co-pilot/AWS code whisperer for serious scripts but I will attach any AI help in the commit message.

There is a .gitignore file but I included it in the .gitignore file itself so it isnt pushed.
